CalSPEED
==========

CalSPEED empowers end-users with a professional-level, industry-standard testing tool to measure the quality and speed of their mobile data connection.

CalSPEED conducts a two-phase test including initial testing and results validation in order to ensure statistically significant measurements. Test your upload speed, download speed, message delay (latency), and message delay variation (jitter) using CalSPEED. The first two metrics measure your Internet usage experience, while the second two measure the voice quality of voice over IP technologies.
